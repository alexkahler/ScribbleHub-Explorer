*Update - 19-02-2023: I'm brainstorming ways to get the necessary data without accessing SH servers. Stay tuned for updates on [SH Forums](https://forum.scribblehub.com/threads/scribblehub-explorer-%E2%80%93-an-ai-powered-novel-recommendation-engine-feedback-needed.13028/)  
Update - 16-02-2023: Tony has asked me to stop scraping SH, so I will not be able to update the ScribbleHub Explorer
unless something changes in the future. I don't know if I will keep adding features, just because it's a good way to train my programming skills.
But this will not include updated content (novels and users). The dataset used in this app is from around last week of January 2023, and the novels are from the beginning of 
Februray 2023. The reading lists had some issues due to the way it was collected, and as such, not all users are 
part of the initial load. If you aren't one of them. Then, sorry. Tough luck.  
I do appreciate you stopping by, and I wish you luck in finding your next novel to read.  
/Unknown Novelist*
                
Welcome to **ScribbleHub Explorer**, your one-stop-shop for finding your next web-novel (or so I hope)!  
As an avid reader, have you ever found yourself in a nightmare where you can't seem to find any good stories?
Well, Unknown Novelist (that's me!) has been there too. That's why I created this project, to help readers 
like you and me find the next great novel to sink our teeth into.

**ScribbleHub Explorer** was created with three key goals in mind: to help aspiring authors get more readers who
love their stories, to enable readers find a good story that suits their taste, and to help 
[ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/) generate more traffic.  
As you may know, I'm strongly against Webnovel and their monetization scheme. I believe that authors deserve to
be paid for their hard work and effort, but I don't think a paywall is the right solution for the webnovel 
community. So, I came up with a way to give back to the community and help keep ScribbleHub the free platform 
that it is.

So, what is **ScribbleHub Explorer**? It's a recommendation system with two parts. The first part is a "pure" 
*Content-based Recommendation System* that calculates the Cosine Similarity between the input and all other 
novels found on ScribbleHub. This system uses existing "features" such as the novel's synopsis, genres, tags,
fandom, rating, etc. to generate recommendations. While these recommendations are not personalized, they can
still be pretty good if you spend a little effort selecting filters, etc.

The second recommendation engine is an AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) system that uses an
*"User-Item based Implicit Collaborative Filtering"* approach and *Alternating Least Squares Matrix 
Factorization* to calculate recommendations (yea, that's a mouthful - and I wanted to sound smart).  
In layman's terms, it compares what you have in your library with what others have and finds what you might
be missing. This method generally gives good suggestions, but it's subject to the "cold start problem" which
means that if you don't have any novels or very few novels in your reading list, the AI can't generate any
recommendations for you. I have some ideas for improving this using a hybrid-engine which you can find out
more about in the [future updates](#future-updates) section below.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg! There are two supporting projects that make **ScribbleHub Explorer**
possible. The first is the **ScribbleHub Spiders**, the workhorse behind gathering all the necessary data.
The Spiders crawl through all 23,000+ novels and save the main-page statistics and 120,000+ users. It's 
important to note that I do NOT collect any copyrighted material or personal information, such as chapter 
content or user details like location. The Spiders only collect the minimum required information according to 
ethical scraping guidelines such as the title, synopsis, rating, readers, favorites, and number of chapters.
All links go directly to the novel and I don't host any content. If you're an author and you would like your 
novel removed from the app, just contact me using the [contact form](#contact).

The **ScribbleHub Spiders** will index **ScribbleHub** once a month, meaning the app will only be updated once
a month with new novels. If you're a user and your profile is disabled for public viewing or you just
created a profile on ScribbleHub, check back later as I plan to make a feature to passively request user profiles soon.
Sorry, but there's no other way around this unless Tony (ScribbleHub admin) 
gives me direct access to the database.

After the Spiders have finished crawling, they generate datasets used by **ScribbleHub RecSys** to train the AI
in recommending novels. This is a computer-intensive task that takes about 2-3 days of compute time, but it 
results in the AI being pre-trained and reduces load time for the end-user (that's you!). The datasets are available on GitHub
as a JSONL file, as well as the source code for both the Spiders and RecSys.
 
Finally, the Statistics page offers information on trending genres, tags, and other data that can inform authors
in their writing and readers in their discovery. I also have plans to update the Statistics page to generate
personalized statistics for readers.    

To end, I would like to thank you for using this app. If you should have any suggestions for improvements then
don't hesitate to contact me using the [contact form](#contact) below. I have several [updates planned](#future-updates), 
so hang tight and check back often. If you want to show your support, then I would greatly appreciate any donations using [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/B0B2756JF).  
Buy me a coffe :coffee: so I can code harder! :)

    stoggle("""What's "Weighted Rating" and how does it differ from ScribbleHub's normal rating?""",
                """One of the key-issues with a regular rating/voting system is that any novel or item that has 
                been rated 5 by one user, will jump straight to the top of a ranking list. Moreover, as more users 
                vote, items that have few votes generally have higher ranking due to the nature of how humans vote
                (either 1 or 5). Lastly, such ranking lists do not take popularity of an item into account. 
                To combat this, IMDB made a simple, but very effective math calculation to factor in popularity, 
                average rating, and number of votes. This is the same algorithm that sits behind IMDB's Top 250 
                Movies. The equation is like this:  \n
$${(WR) = \dfrac{v}{(v+m)} \\times R + \dfrac{m}{(v+m)} \\times C}.$$  
Where;  
- *R* = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)  
- *v* = number of votes for the movie = (votes)  
- *m* = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25000)  
- *C* = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)

The advantage of using this equation to calculate the ratings is that it takes the average rating 
across all items into account, and the number of votes casts including the minimum number to be 
considered (ScribbleHub Explorer has this set to the 90th percentile). With this, novels with only 
one 5* star rating will not have the same impact, or *weight* as a popular novel with many votes, 
but not as high an average rating.

            """Short answer: They're different. Slightly longer answer: The reason that they generate different recommendations

            such as synopsis, genres, tags, and ratings to compare all other novels on ScribbleHub and then calculate
            a ranking list on what is most similar to what you gave it. The Collaborative Filtering Engine is more
            advanced. It uses a complex AI technique to figure out what you like, and then compares your reading list
            with everyone else's to understand what you might be missing out on. In short, it doesn't actually use any
            of the meta-data that each novel has, but "merely" by understanding what everyone else is reading, it can
            come up with a similar novel recommendation based on that. This is why the two systems might give completely
            different recommendations.""")
    stoggle("""What can I do as an author to improve my ranking in the Content-Based Recommendations?""",
            """There are several things that you can do as an author to help improve your ranking visibility.  
            Here are the key takeaways:
            1. Ensure that your novel's synopsis has a clear description of your story.  
            Much like how a human reads your synopsis, so too does the Content Based Engine. It compares the words 
            in other novel's synopsis with yours, which means if it is too unique (i.e., has a lot of links), then 
            it's likely you would be ranked lower. This doesn't mean that you should make your synopsis completely 
            generic either, as that would just put, you in the herd together with the rest. Instead, you should ask 
            yourself, why should other people read my story solely based on my synopsis? And try to write the answer 
            to that question in the form of a synopsis.
            2. Update your genres and tags.  
            The Content-Based Engine uses tags and genres to also make an "informed" decision about whether to recommend 
            your story or not to the user. It examines what the user has requested to find are similar, and then calculates
            the similarity between what is in your novel to what the user has given as input. In short, this means that you
            should try to have the genres and tags that best represent your story. Genres have a slightly higher weight 
            than tags, but that doesn't mean that tags are ignored. If genres describe the *theme* of your story, then tags
            would describe what *going on* in your story. Again, try to hit a middle point where you don't just have 1 genre 
            to describe your story, but instead, ask yourself, "what are the common elements between what I have written, 
            and how do I slightly stand out from the crowd?"
            3. Get more ratings, reviews and favorites.  
            The Content-Based Engine also uses metrics such as number of revies, favorites, and ratings to make a decision 
            about how popular your novel is. If you're a new author with a newly published story; worry not! This is merely 
            an aspect and cannot outweigh the 2 previous features that I mentioned. It uses these metrics as a means to 
            judge whether the user is looking for a popular novel, or if they're trying to find something new. So, as the 
            popularity of your novels grow, you can expect that the novels that you are ranked together with also changes. 
            Don't be afraid to ask your readers for a rating and review!""")
